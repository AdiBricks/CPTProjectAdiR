    "description: The concept of making an Alien World simply was created by looking at assets that were publicly available.  The idea is to follow student provided Mario Game, but try to customize background and actions to be focused on an Alien World.  The Theme of the game is CompSci education, loops, objects, and Monkeys/Dogs as space aliens.\n",

    "Over my Computer Science years I have found that it is a lot more interesting to code if you start with something fun.   Loops are kind of boring, but if you add animation, alien planet, and monkeys what is not to like.\n",

    "### Initial concepts: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mr M (Product Owner, Scrum Master)\n",
    "    - Introduce basic concepts to non coder, even younger children\n",
    "    - Make game easy, instead of start over continue but require more events for success\n",
    "    - Use features like collision, role play, gravity, squish to help in countdown\n",
    "    - Try to integrate coding concepts like Object Oriented Programming,into game\n",

    "    In a distant galaxy, far, far away, there was a world known as \"Codeonia.\" In this realm, software engineers and programmers lived harmoniously, creating and coding various applications for the universe. Among the inhabitants of Codeonia was Java the Hut, a wise and experienced programmer known for his mastery of programming languages.\n",
    "    One day, a group of mischievous bugs and glitches threatened to plunge Codeonia into chaos. These digital nuisances were led by Darth Compiler, a formidable dark coder who sought to corrupt the code of the entire galaxy.\n",

    "    - Use abilities by calling functions.\n",
    "    - Different resources require different variables which we show the player.\n",
    "    - Introduce the concept of objects and classes by having players interact with different spaceship types, each with its own properties and behaviors\n",
