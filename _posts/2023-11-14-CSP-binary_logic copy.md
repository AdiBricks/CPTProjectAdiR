## Key Indicator Grading and Retrospective
This review includes both written and verbal instructions that were provided during <b>Sprint 4</b>.  The term "retrospective" in agile development is an opportunity to make things better.

An agile retrospective is an opportunity for agile development teams to reflect on past work together and <b>identify ways to improve</b>. Agile teams hold retrospective meetings after a time-boxed period of work is complete (typically a sprint lasting two to four weeks). During the retrospective, the team discusses what went well, what did not go as planned, and how to make the next work period better.


### Team Grading Prep (25 minuts)
This <b>"retrospective" to "ideation"</b> week will be used for teams to improve their work (retrospective) and transition into design (ideation) for the Official College Board CPT.

<b>Review Ticket Content</b>.  Teams will provide Teacher with a "Review Ticket" to capture scores, plans, hightlight project, what went well, and what needs improvement.

<b>Utternance Comment</b>.  Team review ticket will be an Utterance comment on this blog.

<b>Crossover Grades</b>.  Teams / Individuals will crossover grade another team.  In the process of development, we often use this type of review to broaden our perspective.


### Review Ticket Header
Use the templates below to <b>assist in grading and retrospection</b> with Review Ticket. This Table is a summary of most important information between Student development teams and Teacher.

### Crossover Grade (25 minutes)

Teams / Individuals will perform crossover grading.
  - <b>Crossover Scrum Master grading</b>. Scrum Master Team A grades Scrum Master Team B.  Place grading in Header of Review Ticket according to templat.  Also, perform individual crossover gradding on each other.  Be sure to be retrospective.
  - <b>Crossover individual grading</b>.   Grade individual by individual(Team A to Team B), if there is an odd person work in a trio.  Be sure that I know name of each grader and who you are grading (ie John M grading of Shane L)
  - <b>After grading is complete</b> Scrum Master or Individuals update scores on top of the review ticket.  Scrum Master review sources for completeness and make sure addition is correct.


### Final Grading
Teacher Grading will be considering any change to final 0.1.  Note, this would be considered both in meeting guidelines of project or extra credit.

- <b>Retrospective improvement</b>.  Teams and individuals will have time to make improvments during the week.   
- <b>Indicators in Crossover are final</b>.  Do not change scoring after these initial indicators are made.  This will be considered "doctoring",
- <b>Extra credit</b>.  If there is concerns on score, understanding, or completenss in this process...  It is possible to add to seed.  Individuals will be responsible to come up with action.
