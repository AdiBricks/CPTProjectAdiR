## Algorithms and Analysis Mini Project

In pairs, work on Fibonnaci and Sorting algoritms.  The objective of this min project is to go through development processes (innovation, feature, integration), learn more Java and learn more frontend ...

- Obtain a deeper understanding of Abstract Classes and Inhertance
- Create several algorithms to solve the same problem(s)
- Study algorithms for efficiency using analytical measurments
- Try to use unique and different data structures and coding styles
- Consider how you will visualize and present these algoritms in the frontend.

## Hacks

### Fibonacci

Create 2 or more methods to solve nth result in the Fibonacci Sequence that are not provided. Build a frontend output to show results and analysis.

[Sample of Fibonacci Frontend](https://thymeleaf.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/mvc/fibonacci?fibseq=7)

### Sorts

Using Abstract Class build a means to evaluate complexity and performance of serveral College Board sorting algorithms.

In sots, you could share a progression of the algorithm.  This is a sample of capturing progressions using of a [Palindrome](https://jinja.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/algorithm/palindrome/) algorithm.

- Use Fibonacci Abstraction code as guide to build an init/sort method for each unique sort: bubble, insertion, selection, and merge.
- In Parent Class store number iterations, comparisons, merges/swaps.   Amount of operations, time, and space used are key things to consider when constructing and algorithm. 
- Build and output methods to compare statistics from sorts and describe BigO complexity in relation to statistics.  
- Start with Console and then work up to Frontend. The output will require thought and design. Be sure to create a mock up for visuals before coding.
